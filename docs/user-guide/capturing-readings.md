# Capturing Meter Readings

Learn how to capture utility meter readings using Senso's smart camera feature and OCR technology.

## Overview

Senso makes it easy to record meter readings by using your device's camera and AI-powered OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to automatically extract meter values. You can also manually input readings when needed.

## Before You Start

### What You'll Need

- A device with a camera (smartphone, tablet, or laptop with webcam)
- Access to your utility meter(s)
- Good lighting conditions
- A stable hand or surface to rest your device

### Supported Meter Types

Senso works with:
- **Water meters** (analog and digital)
- **Electricity meters** (analog and digital)
- Most standard utility meter formats

## Capturing a Reading with Camera

### Step 1: Navigate to Capture Screen

**For Water Meters:**
1. Open Senso
2. Tap or click on **"Water"** in the navigation menu
3. Look for the camera icon or **"Add Reading"** button
4. Click it to open the camera interface

**For Electricity Meters:**
1. Open Senso
2. Navigate to **"Electricity"**
3. Click the camera icon or **"Add Reading"** button

### Step 2: Position Your Camera

1. **Frame the meter** - Ensure the entire display is visible in the viewfinder
2. **Get close enough** - Digits should be clearly visible but not cut off
3. **Ensure good lighting** - Use natural light or turn on lights if needed
4. **Minimize glare** - Adjust angle to avoid reflections
5. **Hold steady** - Keep the camera still to avoid blur

**Tips for Best Results:**
- Fill about 60-80% of the frame with the meter face
- Keep the camera parallel to the meter face
- Avoid shadows falling on the digits
- Clean the meter glass if it's dirty or foggy

### Step 3: Capture the Image

1. Once positioned correctly, tap the **capture button** (usually a large circle at the bottom)
2. You'll see a preview of the captured image
3. If the image is blurry or unclear, tap **"Retake"**
4. If the image looks good, proceed to the next step

### Step 4: Review OCR Results

After capture, Senso's AI processes the image:

1. **Wait for processing** - Usually takes 2-5 seconds
2. **Review the extracted value** - The AI displays what it read from the meter
3. **Check confidence score** - Shows how confident the AI is in its reading
   - ðŸŸ¢ **High (90-100%)**: Very confident, likely accurate
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium (70-89%)**: Reasonably confident, double-check the value
   - ðŸ”´ **Low (<70%)**: Less confident, verify carefully or retake

### Step 5: Confirm or Adjust

**If the reading is correct:**
1. Click **"Confirm"** or **"Save Reading"**
2. The reading is saved to your account
3. You'll see a success message

**If the reading needs adjustment:**
1. Click in the value field
2. Manually edit the incorrect digits
3. Click **"Save"** when corrected

**If you need to retake:**
1. Click **"Retake Photo"** or **"Cancel"**
2. Go back to Step 2 and capture again

### Step 6: Add Optional Information

After confirming the reading, you may be able to add:
- **Notes** - Add context about the reading
- **Tags** - Mark special readings (e.g., "after vacation", "summer peak")
- **Photo** - The captured image is automatically saved

Click **"Save"** to finalize.

## Manual Input Method

If the camera isn't working or you prefer manual entry:

### When to Use Manual Input

- Camera access is unavailable
- OCR consistently fails for your meter type
- You're entering historical readings
- You prefer typing the value

### How to Enter Manually

1. Navigate to the meter type (Water or Electricity)
2. Look for **"Manual Input"** or **"Enter Manually"** option
3. Type the meter reading in the input field
4. Add any optional information (date, notes)
5. Click **"Save Reading"**

## Understanding Reading Types

### Regular Readings
Standard meter captures done on a recurring basis.

### Manual Adjustments
When you correct an OCR reading or enter a value manually.

### Historical Readings
Past readings entered retroactively to build data history.

## Best Practices

### For Accurate OCR

1. **Lighting is critical**
   - Natural daylight is best
   - Use a flashlight if meter is in a dark location
   - Avoid harsh direct sunlight causing glare

2. **Camera positioning**
   - Hold device parallel to meter face
   - Keep steady (use both hands or a surface)
   - Get close but don't cut off digits

3. **Meter condition**
   - Clean dirty or foggy meter glass
   - Report damaged meters to utility company
   - Note if digits are hard to read even by eye

### Reading Consistency

1. **Regular schedule**
   - Read meters at consistent times
   - Daily or weekly readings recommended
   - Same time of day if possible

2. **Same location**
   - Use the same camera angle each time
   - Stand in the same spot
   - Consistent framing helps

3. **Document issues**
   - Add notes if meter looks unusual
   - Photo evidence useful for disputes
   - Track maintenance or meter replacements

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

**Permission Issues:**
1. Check browser permissions for camera access
2. Grant camera permission when prompted
3. Reload the page after granting permission

**Technical Issues:**
1. Try a different browser
2. Restart your device
3. Check if camera works in other apps
4. Use manual input as fallback

### OCR Not Reading Correctly

**Improve image quality:**
- Better lighting
- Cleaner meter face
- Closer distance
- Steadier hold

**Try different angles:**
- Slight tilt can reduce glare
- Different times of day for lighting
- Use flash or external light

**Manual correction:**
- Edit the OCR result
- Use manual input instead
- Report problematic meter types

### Low Confidence Scores

If you consistently get low confidence:
1. Follow image quality tips above
2. Try manual input for this meter
3. Consider if meter is damaged or unusual
4. Document issues with photos

### Reading Not Saving

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Try again after a moment
4. Check for error messages
5. Contact support if persistent

## Viewing Your Readings

After saving readings:
1. They appear in your **Dashboard**
2. View reading history in **History** section
3. See consumption calculations automatically
4. Readings feed into analytics and forecasting

## Editing or Deleting Readings

### Edit a Reading

1. Navigate to reading history
2. Find the reading to edit
3. Click **"Edit"** icon
4. Update the value or details
5. Save changes

### Delete a Reading

1. Find the reading in history
2. Click **"Delete"** icon
3. Confirm deletion
4. Reading is permanently removed

**Note**: Deleting readings may affect analytics and forecasts.

## Multiple Meters

If you have multiple meters of the same type:
1. Add notes to distinguish them (e.g., "Main house", "Guest unit")
2. Some installations support multiple meter profiles
3. Capture each meter separately
4. Label clearly to avoid confusion

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with good habits** - Consistent readings from day one
2. **Double-check first few readings** - Ensure OCR is working well
3. **Set reminders** - Use Senso's notification feature
4. **Review immediately** - Check that reading saved correctly
5. **Monitor trends** - Unusual jumps may indicate OCR errors
