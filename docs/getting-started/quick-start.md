## Next Steps

Now that you're set up, here's what to do next:

### Build Your Data History
- Record meter readings regularly (daily or weekly recommended)
- Consistent readings enable better analytics and forecasting
- Set up reading reminders to maintain a schedule

### Explore Features
- Review your [Analytics Dashboard](../user-guide/analytics.md)
- Understand [Anomaly Detection](../user-guide/analytics.md#anomaly-detection)
- Learn about [Cost Forecasting](../technical-docs/cost-forecasting-flow.md)

### Optimize Your Usage
- Monitor consumption patterns
- Identify peak usage times
- Act on anomaly alerts to detect leaks early
- Use forecasts to budget effectively

## Tips for Best Results

### Camera Tips:
- Use good lighting when capturing meter readings
- Hold your device steady
- Ensure digits are clear and not blurred
- Capture the entire meter display in frame
- Avoid glare and reflections

### Data Accuracy:
- Record readings at consistent times
- Double-check auto-detected values
- Use manual input if OCR confidence is low
- Update billing rates when they change

### Getting Insights:
- At least 10 readings needed for anomaly detection
- 30+ days of data required for accurate forecasting
- More frequent readings = better pattern recognition

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working?
- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Use the manual input option as a fallback
- See [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md)

### OCR Not Reading Correctly?
- Improve lighting conditions
- Clean the meter face
- Try different angles
- Use manual input for difficult meters

### Not Seeing Analytics?
- Record more readings (minimum 10 for anomalies)
- Wait for data accumulation (30+ days for forecasts)
- Check that readings are being saved correctly
