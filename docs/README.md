# Senso - Utility Monitoring PWA

Welcome to the Senso documentation! Senso is a Progressive Web Application designed to help you monitor and manage your utility consumption through intelligent meter reading, anomaly detection, and cost forecasting.

## What is Senso?

Senso is a comprehensive utility monitoring solution that combines modern web technologies with machine learning to provide:

- **Automated Meter Reading**: Capture and process utility meter readings using your device's camera
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Machine learning models detect anomalies and forecast costs
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track water and electricity consumption in real-time
- **Smart Notifications**: Get alerted about unusual consumption patterns
- **Cost Forecasting**: Predict future utility costs based on historical data

## Key Features

### üì∏ Smart Camera Integration
Capture meter readings using your device's camera with automatic OCR processing powered by computer vision and deep learning models.

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Analytics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest models identify unusual consumption patterns
- **Cost Forecasting**: Linear Regression and Random Forest models predict future costs
- **Pattern Recognition**: CNN-based models extract accurate readings from images

### üìä Comprehensive Dashboard
View your utility consumption trends, compare usage across different periods, and track your savings goals.

### üîî Intelligent Notifications
Receive alerts for:
- Unusual consumption patterns
- Billing reminders
- Reading schedule reminders
- Anomaly detection results

### üîê Secure & Private
Built with Supabase authentication and Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure your data remains private and secure.
