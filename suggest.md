1. Feature Construction

In predict_billing_aware_cost, the features you pass to the model are simplistic:

rolling_avg_7day and rolling_avg_30day = just the daily_consumption (not real rolling averages).

billing_cycle_day and elapsed_days are redundant (often equal).

Since RandomForest depends heavily on feature quality, these weakly informative features limit prediction power.

Effect: Predictions may look almost like a flat scaling of daily_consumption.

2. Training Data Conversion

_create_training_data converts monthly bills into uniform daily samples → assumes consumption and cost are evenly distributed across the month.

_convert_meter_readings_to_training takes differences between readings and approximates daily consumption, but uses approximate cost via utility_rates_service (not actual billing rules).

Effect: The model sees “smoothed” data, not real-world peaks/valleys. Predictions become biased toward averages.

3. Model Choice and Setup

You’re using RandomForestRegressor:

Good for nonlinear relationships, but tends to predict the average when features are weak or noisy.

With limited training samples, it will generalize poorly and flatten predictions.

Feature scaling with StandardScaler has no real effect on RandomForest (since it’s tree-based).

Effect: Predictions often hover around the mean daily cost instead of reacting strongly to input changes.

4. Fallback Logic in _predict_cost

Your _predict_cost currently ignores the trained model and instead:

base_rate = 12.0
return features.daily_consumption * base_rate


The trained RandomForest never actually runs in prediction!

Effect: All results are basically linear scaling by 12.0 (or 10.0 if fallback triggers), not machine learning.

5. Data Quality

If your clean_readings are sparse or inconsistent, training data will be too small → model may not train properly.

train_initial_model accepts as few as 5 samples → highly unstable model.

Effect: Unreliable or highly variable predictions, depending on small dataset quirks.

6. Billing-Cycle Projection

In predict_billing_aware_cost, you project monthly cost using:

cycle_average * billing_position.total_cycle_days


This projection assumes future days mirror the past average.

Effect: Monthly cost is often an extrapolated average, not a true ML prediction.

⚡ Why You’re Seeing Your Results

Main culprit: _predict_cost bypasses your trained model → predictions are fixed multiplications (not learned).

Secondary factor: Features are weak / redundant → even if you used the model, it would learn mostly “average consumption × fixed rate.”

Additional noise: Sparse or simplified training data → smooth averages dominate instead of real consumption dynamics.

✅ If you want actual ML-driven predictions, the first fix is to replace your _predict_cost logic to call model.predict() using the scaler + trained model.
