5.0 per day and 60 pesos per day? isnt this not realistic or will it change with inputs

1. predict_billing_aware_cost

Issues

Features created ad-hoc → risk of mismatch with training.

rolling_avg_7day and rolling_avg_30day set equal to daily_consumption (not actual rolling stats).

Monthly projection assumes flat consumption (cycle_average * total_cycle_days).

Silent fallback risk (errors only logged).

Feature importance hardcoded instead of pulled from model.

Suggestions

Use a centralized FeatureBuilder for consistency.

Compute true rolling averages from recent readings.

Distinguish ML-based vs linear extrapolation projections.

Add "prediction_mode" (e.g., "ml", "baseline", "fallback") in return object.

Log warnings for fallback predictions.

2. update_with_meter_readings

Issues

Frequent retraining may cause instability (model thrashing).

Race conditions possible (async + shared self.models).

May skip updates if insufficient data (stale model).

Suggestions

Batch retrains (e.g., daily or N readings).

Add asyncio.Lock or a job queue to avoid concurrent retraining.

Use configurable thresholds before retraining (not just < 5 samples).

Differentiate "update only" vs "full retrain".

3. _create_training_data

Issues

Feature extraction duplicated across methods.

No normalization across utility types (kWh vs m³).

Possible poor weight balancing (older vs newer data).

Suggestions

Centralize feature extraction logic.

Normalize per-unit values for different utilities.

Use recency-based sample weighting.

Validate dataset shape before training.

4. _convert_meter_readings_to_training

Issues

Assumes readings are clean (CNN/OCR noise ignored).

Missing values or outliers not handled.

Possible misalignment with billing cycles.

Suggestions

Apply anomaly detection before conversion (Isolation Forest).

Interpolate or flag missing days.

Generate both daily features and billing-cycle aggregates.

Add validation to discard impossible values (e.g., negative consumption).

5. train_initial_model

Issues

If little data is available, still persists as "READY" model.

No clear baseline if ML training fails.

Relies on historical_data_service without validation.

RandomForest only → not considering simpler fallback models.

Suggestions

Add explicit fallback: if insufficient data, store "baseline" model (linear scaling).

Tag models with type ("baseline", "ml", "hybrid").

Include training summary in logs: sample count, average daily use, data span.

Periodically validate and retrain when more data arrives.

⚡ Cross-Cutting Concerns

Consistency: Multiple functions build features differently → centralize with FeatureBuilder.

Transparency: Predictions should clearly state whether they came from ML or fallback.

Retraining cadence: Define and enforce retraining policy.

Error handling: Don’t silently fallback — return warnings in results.

Persistence alignment: Ensure saved models and in-memory models are always in sync.
